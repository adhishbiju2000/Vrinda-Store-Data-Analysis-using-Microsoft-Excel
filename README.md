## Problem statement
1) Compare the sales and order using single chart
2) which month got the higest sales and order?
3) who purchased more men or women in 2022?
4) what are differnet oreder status in 2022?
5) List to 10 states contributing to the sales?
6) Relation between age and gender based on number?
7) which channel is contributing to maximum sales?
8) Highest selling Category?

## Data cleaning
1) Checking Duplicate and null values.
2) But in Gender column there are some improper data format such as m for male and w for women.So we had to convert m to male and w to women.
3) Rest the columns are proper format.

 ## Data processing
 1) Created new coloum name Age Group
   ----------- where below 18 are Teenager and above 18 to 50 are Adulit and 50 above are senior.
 2) We make a Month coloum
   ----------- =TEXT (G2,"mmm")
